## Business problem

- Here you can follow the official description about the data coleted at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit):
``` 
  "    The Bank who decides who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted.
   This competition requires participants to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring, by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.      "
   ```


-  Followed by this description, i would like to introduce this by myself:
>   Imagine you are a bank owner that recently opened this business. Among other banking problems (such as a management system, security system, etc.), you notice that your bank is offering loans to people who are not paying their debts properly.
In addition, employees are offering them credit limits that are far above normal when compared to their monthly income. 
So, you decide to hire a general team of Data Scientists/Machine learning who are offering a credit analysis system to decide if a loan should be granted or not. So, for now, you are the bank owner and I'm in the development team :). My team's task is to develop a model from the provided dataset and send it to another team to link the system itself to the model

## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
